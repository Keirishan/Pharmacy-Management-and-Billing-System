# Pharmarcy Management and Billing System

## Abstract

Our project was to develop a pharmacy billing system software. In other words, a software which could control all the functions in the pharmacy simply and easily. A billing machine is a machine specifically designed to generate customer invoices. It generates invoices and saves a record of the same in its database. Various types of billing machines are available in the market, such as portable, automatic, handheld machines, bus ticketing machines, etc. Every business is required to issue receipts for which billing machines are essential. It has automated and advanced settings that help in the speedy generation of bills. It took around six weeks to complete the whole project with the help of the team members. We have divided the total workload into small parts so then we can focus on each part much better and efficiently. There were many subparts inside the main topic such as making the bill, updating the database, adding to the database the stock and also the details about the medicines. Anyway, arranging and organizing the tasks was a bit challenging since we were unable to meet each other. So therefore, we had to do our allocated tasks individually after taking meetings to discuss the progress of the project weekly. Since we were asked to use an object-oriented programming language to develop the software, we chose the “JAVA” language after a long discussion. We used NetBeans software as our IDE to develop the software. In addition to that, we used MySQL to design and develop the database of the software. Since this is a software, we did not want to spent a rupee for the budget. It is only about the time knowledge and implementation.

## Approach

This project is all about developing a software to make the things easier in managing a Pharmacy. This is also a great fortune for us to know specially about the hierarchy of a Pharmacy and about the basic functions and operations. In terms of the Pharmacy, they also have a huge number of benefits such as they can reduce the man power or the number of employees who are working in the Pharmacy. In addition to that, the mistakes which are going to occur will be decreased when the system is implemented.

### Graphical View

2. This is the interface that we can see in our display of the system.

3. If we give the incorrect username and password, it will not allow to anything further more. It will give us an error message.

6. We can insert new drugs directly into the database by using manage drug option.

7. When we insert a drug that is not in the database in the drug code option it will show an error message.

## Conclusion

The pharmacy management system provides functions on identify medication usages instruction, minimize human errors in medication safety, facilitate accessibility of drugs information and information management among employees, providing optimal drugs movement in pharmacy unit, enable reports with in significantly short period of time. despite simultaneous usage of database for the purpose stated above.

The system will solve the problem of the current system by minimizing time wastage and reduce resources which simply change manual based system to computerized system.
